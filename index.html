        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Different types of web design:</h2>
            <p>In order to understand mobile/responsive web design and development, we have to understand what our options are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed</li>
                <li>Fluid</li>
                <li>Adaptive</li>
                <li>Responsive</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Fixed web design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">What it sounds like!</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Everything has a set width (eg. 960px). A holdover from before mobile "smart" devices were common.</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Resize the browser, or look at it on a mobile screen and nothing will change</li>
                    <li class="delayed">You'll need an "m dot" site if you want something mobile friendly :( </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="delayed">Example: <a href="http://toronto.ca">toronto.ca</a> </br>(open this up on your phone or resize the browser)</p>
                <p class="delayed">Example: <a href="https://m.facebook.com/">m.facebook.com</a></p>

            <h2>Fluid web design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">Based on percentages</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Each block of content takes up some percentage of the page, for example a sidebar with a width of ~30% and main section with a width of ~70%</li>
                    <li class="delayed">When you resize the browser, the blocks of content will resize relative to the size of the page (aka the "viewport")</li>
                    <li class="delayed"><strong>Not</strong> made for specific devices. Just reducing the width of your content is usually not the best experience for small screens, doesn't give us enough control.</li>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Adaptive web design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">Uses a series fixed layouts</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Then adds in media queries to target specific viewport sizes</li>
                    <li class="delayed">The content itself changes</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Best to think of it as a <em>set</em> of fixed layouts that are envoked in response to the device size</li>

                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">Uses a fluid grid layout to get that sweet free adaptability</li>
                    <li class="delayed"><em>Also</em> uses media queries to change the look and feel depending on device size</li>
                    <li class="delayed">So your grid is both <strong>flexible</strong> inbetween common device sizes, and designed with <strong>breakpoints</strong> so that content is presented in the most suitable way for the device.</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Content stays largely the same or similar.</li>

          <blockquote>"When you lose 80% of your screen real estate, all the extraneous bloat that tends to finds its way onto large screen designs doesnâ€™t seem so attractive or necessary anymore. Mobile provides a great opportunity to reevaluate what content/functionality is necessary and gives us an opportunity to strip away the cruft across the board (and not just for mobile users either). These constraints also encourage ease-of-use, intuitiveness and speed as essential ingredients to a good user experience."

          <h1>Crash Course in HTML5</h1>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
        <h2>A bit of background info</h2>
          <p>HTML5, or "HyperText Markup Language" is what we wrap the <strong>content</strong> of our site in. It's the only thing you truly need to have a website.</p>
          <p>However, it takes on default styles of the browser. Uuuuugly. We'll learn how to override these styles in a bit with CSS, which is where we do all our cosmetic changes.</p>
          <p>For now, let's open up our starter HTML file, <strong>html-ex1.html</strong> in your <strong>"examples" folder</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>This is it!</h2>
          <p>This is everthing you need for your HTML file to work properly in a browser.</p>
          <p>NOTE: those things inside of <code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code> are comments!</p> 
          <p>Go ahead and type anything inside the <code>&#60;body&#62;&#60;&#47;body&#62;</code> tags</p>
          <p>Then refresh your browser's page to see the results!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Tags/Elements

Those things with the angled brackets are called HTML tags, they tell the browser what kind of content each of the bits of your website is. The tags plus the content inside of them are an HTML "element".

There's almost always an "opening" tag and a "closing" one. The closing tag has a forward slash. Example: opening paragraph tag: `&#60;p&#62;` closing paragraph tag: `&#60;&#47;p&#62;`

You close tags in the reverse order in which they appear, just like in math. For example, in this code block:

```xml
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;paragraph wrapped in a link wrapped in a span&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
```
The span opens, the `a` (a link or "anchor" tag) opens, then the paragraph opens. The paragraph closes, the link closes, then the span closes.
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide">
        <h2>Important Note!</h2>
          <p>Remember, HTML is about content, it has default browser styles but it is not for styling your document. That's what CSS is for, and we need to keep the both separate!</p>
          <p>So let's review what we've learned so far and learn what some common HTML elements are.</p>
          <p>Open up our second HTML example file, <strong>html-ex2.html</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Siblings, Parents, and Children</h2>
            <p>Elements can have "relationships" with other elements in the HTML document.</p>
            <p>If you put one element inside of another, the element on the outside is the <strong>"parent"</strong> element, while the one inside is the <strong>"child"</strong> element. You can have many child elements inside of a parent, but they all only have one parent.</p>
            <p>Two or more elements that are both children of the <em>same</em> element are called <strong>"siblings"</strong> - they are on the same level as each other. For example the <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>elements in every HTML document</p>
        </section>
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Parent, Child, Siblings Example</h2>
            <pre><code>
&lt;body&gt; &lt;!--this body element is a parent to the div element and normally a child of the html element--&gt;
  &lt;div&gt; &lt;!--this div is a child of the body element, and a parent of the p elements--&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a sibling of the p below me! I am also a child of the div.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a sibling of the p above me! I am also a child of the div&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>Notice the way that the tags are indented, so that you can easily read the HTML and see what is a child, parent, and sibling of what elements. This will come in handy later, so keep up this way of indenting (2 spaces or one tab)</p>
        </section>
        <section class="slide">
          <h2>HTML Element Relationships:</h2>
          <p>Don't worry about what each of these are, we'll go over that very soon. Just look at the structure.</p>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>One more thing...HTML Attributes!</h2>
          <p>Elements can have things called "attributes". There's also lots of attributes, but don't worry there's only a few you'll need to know for this workshop:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"class" or "id", used mostly for styling</li>
            <li>"href", used in the opening anchor tag, it contains a URL for the link</li>
            <li>"alt", used as alternate text if the website can't represent the content or a screen reader is being used</li>
            <li>"src", meaning source, used mostly for images, gives the url path for the embedded content</li>
          </ul>

          <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets"</p>

          <p>Just like HTML, CSS has it's own way of writing it that we have to learn. It looks a little something like this:</p>
<textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#intro-css">background-color: lightblue;
font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;</textarea>
            <div id="intro-css" class="example">

            </div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##CSS and HTML

A CSS document is made up of a bunch of lines of code, or "rules", that keep referring back to the HTML elements in our HTML document

These rules are always made up of a **selector** and one or more **declarations**. Each declaration has a **property** and a **value**.

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

The **selector** tells what element(s) to apply the styling to. The **declaration** contains what styles to apply. 
```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
``` 
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>An Example</h2>
          <pre><code>
            body {
              background-color: pink;
              color: white;
              font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
              font-size: 16px;
            }

            p {
              border: 1px solid #333;
              color: #000;
              font-weight: italic;
            }
          </code></pre>
          <p>Here we have two selectors (body and p) and they each have their own sets of declatarions inside the { } brackets. The body selector has four declarations, while the p selector has three.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>An Example cont.</h2>
          <pre><code>
            div {
              border: 3px solid #333;
              background-color: lightblue;
            }
          </code></pre>
          <p>Notice that each declaration ends in a semi-colon, and starts on a new line. In addition each property ends in a colon. These are necessary for the browser to understand your styles. The colon and semi-colon are used here a lot like they are in English!</p> 
          <p>Although you could write all the styles on one line, that's hard to read, so always format your CSS rules this way</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Writing CSS - Where Does it Go?</h2>
          <p>You can technically put CSS in one of three places: inline, internal, and in it's own document (linked/external).</p>
          <p>In this class, we're going to skip the first two because they're not good practice anyway, and go straight to making our own CSS documents.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We've already seen inline styles used in our examples with the "style" attribute, and internal CSS is just CSS rules all together inside the head element, using a style tag.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>CSS Properties</h2>
          <p>If you thought there were a lot of HTML elements, there are even more CSS properties!</p>

##CSS Selectors
###Type Selectors
```css

  /*styles for all divs on the page*/
}

a {
  /*styles for all links on the page*/  
}

p {
  /*styles for all paragraphs on the page*/
}

##CSS Selectors cont.
###Descendant Selectors
```css
div p {
  /*all paragraphs that are descendants of any divs*/
}

ul li a {
  /*links inside of list items inside of unordered lists. 
  Question: will this affect links inside of ordered lists (ol's)?*/
}
```

###Class Selectors

.container {
  /*styles for all elements with a class of container, no matter what type*/
}

p.container {
  /*styles for all paragraph elements with a class of "container"*/
}

p.container a {
  /*guess what this one does!*/
}
.container .warning {
  /*how about this one?*/
}

.container.warning {
  /*styles for all elements with BOTH a class of container and warning*/

          <h2>CSS Selectors cont.</h2>
          <p>Let's look at our example five CSS and HTML files again, and try to find each type of selector and the grouping we've just learned about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Type Selectors</li>
            <li>Descendant Selectors</li>

          <h2>Inheritance</h2>
          <p>If we look at our <strong>css-ex5.css</strong> file again and look at the body selector. It has a font-size and font-family and so on set on it. But our webpage clearly has paragraphs and other elements we could declare a font on. Why is it on body then?</p>
          <p>Remember that CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets? Now we know what they mean by cascading! The browser reads the CSS from the top of the page down, and some of these styles are "inherited" from their parents.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Specificity
###What's going on here? Why are there so many "h2"'s?
```css
h2, h3, h4 {
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  margin: 0;
}

h2, h3 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 32px;
}

section h2 {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Specificity cont.
The most specific OR the most recent CSS rule will be selected. Which one gets selected is based largely on magic.

GENERAL RULE: the styles for an element that came last in the CSS document will be used, unless overridden by a more "specific" selector. Classes, for example, make things more specific than just a type selector would be.

Example:
```css
p {
  /*less specific*/
}

p.special-paragraph {
  /*more specific*/
}
```

          <h2>Responsive Design</h2> 
          <p>Remember: responsive design simply means <strong>the best user experience on all devices.</strong></p>
          <p>Responsive CSS will react to the resizing of the browser's viewport (the bit of the page you can see on your screen without scrolling) and change it's rules to best suit that viewport size.</p>
          <p>How???</p> 
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Media Queries</h2>
          <p>A fluid layout using percentages + media queries = responsive design</p>
          <p>Step one: the meta viewport tag</p>
          <pre><code>
            &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;
          </code></pre>
          <p>Without this our media queries won't work. It goes inside the head tags in our HTML document. Don't forget it!</p>
          <p>Let's add it in to our final project site now.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Media Queries cont.</h2>
          <p><strong>What do media queries do?</strong></p>
          <p>They apply CSS to your document only when the viewport has reached a certain size (eg. 1200px)</p>
          <p><strong>What do they look like?</strong></p>
          <pre><code>
            @media (max-width: 1200px) {
              body {
                background-color: purple;
              }
            }
          </code></pre>
          <p>The above says any viewport with a maximum width of 1200px will have a body with a background-color of purple. So any screen 1200px wide or LESS will get the styles inside of this media query.</p> 
          <p>If the viewport is 1201px will the background be purple? What if it's 1199px?</p>

        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Coding Media Queries
First, let's add some background colours into each media query to help us see where the breakpoints are, like this:

```css
/* Portrait tablet and small desktops */
@media (max-width: 940px) {
  body {
    background-color: pink;
  }
}
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Coding Media Queries cont.
Let's try changing the size of the text (.box p) to 3rem, 2.5rem, and then 2rem.

The first one will look like this:

```css
/* Portrait tablet and small desktops */
@media (max-width: 940px) {
  body {
    background-color: pink;
  }
  .box p {
    font-size: 3rem;
  }
}
```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Coding Media Queries cont.
How about the size of the text in the aside (sidebar) and the big paragraph?

Lets make them a bit smaller on smaller size screens. 

How about **1.5rem on the p selector**? Remember why that won't effect the paragraph in the .box div?
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Coding Media Queries cont.</h2>
          <p>Let's try one more, a harder one this time. The aside element looks pretty squished when we resize the browser to a smaller viewport.</p>
          <p>Let's make the element sit on top of the three .box elements</p>
          <p>But...how?</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="delayed">Set the width of the aside to 100%</li>

##Hiding Elements
Don't make this a habit: it's convenient but the browser still needs to load this code, and that slows your site down. Use it sparingly!

```css
@media (max-width: somewidthpx) {
  somediv {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
That's it! If we look at our site as a small phone in the emulator we can see the "download pdf" button takes up too much screen real estate - let's hide it on our smallest screens.

          <p class="delayed">When in doubt, just use rems, and set font-size on your html element (default usually 16px).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Making our Web Copy Responsive
Let's go through our final project CSS and change some of the font-sizes to rems.

Since the root font-size is 16px, just divide the pixel size in the CSS by 16. 

Example:

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "Pacifico", cursive;
  font-size: 5rem; /*used to be 80px*/
  font-weight: 400;
  margin: 0;
}
```

          <h2>Margin and Padding</h2>
          <p>From the 768px media query down, the circles in the Skills section don't look great. We can change this by adjusting our <strong>margin</strong> and <strong>padding</strong> values.</p>
          <ol>

            <li class="delayed">Next, we'll go to our CSS and target that class in our 768px media query</li>
            <li class="delayed">We want to space the circles out a bit more, so let's add a margin to the elements</li>
          </ol>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Resizing Elements</h2>
          <p>You might notice that at our 480px media query the circles are in one long line. They're taking up too much room! Scrolling is boring, so let's make these a bit smaller.</p>
          <p>Again, target the element in the media query. Then change the height, width, margin, and line-height properties.</p>
          <p>Oh no! the font size is too big too, let's change that! Notice how we don't have to include the margin value from the last query - remember styles inherit/cascade!</p>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Profile Image</h2>
          <p>Our profile image gets really small at smaller screens. It also takes up a lot of room from 480px. What should we do with it?</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Make it a bit smaller by changing width to 60%</li>
            <li>set the display property to the value "block"</li>
            <li>set margin to 0 auto, the magical centering declaration for block elements</li>
            <li>Set float to "none", as it was float:left before</li>
            <li>Go back to margin and actually set it to     margin:0 auto 4rem; to put some space on the bottom</li>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Centering Text, Removing Floats

The content under our profile picture doesn't look so hot on our smallest screen. Centering content is a simple, common way of getting some white space on a cramped mobile screen.

Try this out on our 480px media query:

```css
.profile .summary {
  text-align: center;
  float: none;
  width: 100%; /*notice we still have padding from the code above*/
}
```

          <p>When in doubt:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Center content (but keep it readable and large enough on small screens)</li>
