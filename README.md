###Mobile Navigation:

Unfortunately I ran out of time and can't make the mobile nav slides right now, but check out this great post on how to make various kinds of responsive mobile navs: [css-tricks.com/responsive-menu-concepts](http://css-tricks.com/responsive-menu-concepts)

You can do any of the ones that say "no javascript required" (or try the Javascript one(s) as a next step if you're feeling adventurous! -->
