		<h3>Here's a nifty subtitle</h3>
		<p>Here's some text wrapped in paragraph tags. Text is great.</p>
		<!--add another paragraph element here, and put some text inside of it-->
		<p>Some text. Aha.</p>
		<!--make an unordered list with five list items inside of it-->

		<p>"Does he fan-tail <span>a little curious</span>, sir, before he goes down?" said the Gay-Header deliberately.</p>
		<p>"And has he a curious spout, too," said Daggoo, "<em>very bushy</em>, even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?"</p>

		<!--put a link (an anchor tag) around the words "believe my statement" and link it to http://google.ca- don't forget the alt and href attributes! -->
		<p>She gazed at me with troubled eyes, long and questioningly.  That it was difficult to <a href="http://google.ca" alt="Google search page" target="_blank">believe my statement</a> I well knew, nor could I hope that she would do so however much I craved her confidence and respect. I would much rather not have told her anything of my antecedents, but no man could look into the depth of those eyes and refuse her slightest behest.</p>
