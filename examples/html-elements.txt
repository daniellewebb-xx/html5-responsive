A list of important HTML elements:

<element></element> - description/name of element

THE "ROOT" ELEMENT:
<html></html> - html element. Every other element lives inside of this one.


METADATA:
<head></head> - the metadata for the site goes between these tags. It doesn't show up on the webpage.

<meta> - generic tag for metadata. Used inbetween the head element.

<link> - used to link CSS (and Javascript) with the HTML document.

<title></title> - what's in here goes on the tab bar for the page, can only contain text.


CONTENT SECTIONS:
<body></body> - everything inside of these tags shows up on the web page. There can only be one of these per HTML document.

<section></section> - generic section of a doc, should have a heading (h1 - h6) as a child element.

<nav></nav> - a section with only navigation links.

<article></article> - content that could exist independently of the rest of the site's content, think a blog article.

<aside></aside> - content loosely related to the page content. Could be removed and page would still make sense. Think a sidebar.

<header></header> - not to be confused with <head></head>! Usually contains logo, title, and nav element.

<main></main> - the main/important content of a page.

<footer></footer> - usually has a copyright notice, sitemap, contact information, etc.

<h1></h1>, <h2></h2>, <h3></h3>, <h4></h4>, <h5><h5>, <h6></h6> - heading elements, in order of most to least important. Generally only one h1 element on a page, but can be multiple of any of them.


"GROUPING" CONTENT:
<p></p> - a paragraph

<ol></ol> - an ordered list (1., 2., 3.)

<ul></ul> - an unordered list (bulleted list)

<li></li> - list elements. At least one must go inside of all ul and ol elements.

<div></div> - generic container, no semantic meaning. Block element.


INLINE SEMANTIC ELEMENTS:
<span></span> - generic text element, no semantic meaning. Only use if no other more semantic elements are suitable.

<a></a> - a link a.k.a "anchor" tag

<em></em> - text with emphasis, like a stress accent.

<strong></strong> - text that is especailly important.

<br> - line break.


EMBEDDED CONTENT (in this case,media):
<img> - an image


*************************************************************
For extra fun times, check out the <form> and <table> elements - forms are used all over on websites, tables are used much less these days. But they're still both important tags!

NOTE: the elements above that don't have closing tags don't need them! It's not a typo :)
