	<!-- notice that each tag has an opening tag (eg. <p>) and a closing tag (eg. </p> - that backslash means close. Almost all html elements need both of these to surround the content) -->
	<h1>This is a header!</h1>
	<h2>This is a slightly less important header</h2>
	<h3>There's six of these guys :o</h3> <!--They go from h1 down to h6, getting progressively smaller as they go-->
	<p>This is a paragraph!</p>
	<p>I can put elements inside of other elements, for example when I need to <strong>bold</strong>, <em>emphasize</em>, or <a href="http://google.ca">link</a> text.</p>
	<!--but note that while the strong and emphasis bolds and italicizes text in most cases, these elements are used for semantic reasons, not stylistic ones!-->

	<div style="border:3px solid goldenrod;">This is a box of holding. It has no semantic meaning.</div>
	<span style="border:1px dashed purple">This is an in-line box of holding, also with no real meaning. It's just convenient!</span>

	<div>
		<p style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">Here's more content, styled using inline styles. But they're bad! We don't use these ever.</p>
		<p>Here's a paragraph, "nested" inside of a div element, with a <span style="color:purple; font-size:30px;">span tag</span> wrapped around a few of its words for styling purposes.</p>
